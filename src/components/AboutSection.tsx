        <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I'm Kaleb, a software engineer whose love for technology started with robots in high school. I was hooked on the moment code made metal move. That curiosity grew into a drive to build things that solve real problems for real people.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Now, I put that obsession to work as a builder and researcher. I studied Computer Science at Andrews University, I'm pursuing my Master's at the University of Maryland, and I've shipped across the stack from ML research to full-stack engineering at Real AI Dynamics to a software engineering internship at Aurora Web Studio. I recently launched Mesgana, an Amharic SDA hymnal app on the App Store that brings offline worship to communities worldwide because impact matters.

          If you want to swap ideas about building useful tech reach out, I'm always up for turning good problems into working products.
